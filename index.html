                        effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter
                        and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water.
                        The essence stays invisibly below.”

                        actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that

                Since then, it has often dropped by, showing up in phone numbers
                and the serial numbers of products that I've bought. It obviously
                likes me, so I've decided to keep it."</p>
